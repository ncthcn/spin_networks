The goal of this project is to calculate the angle between two open units of a particular spin network. 
This spin networks is that of an example of building Euclidean space our of simple spin-1/2 exchanges between
big open units X, Y and Z.
The expected result is to see that the probability of two open ends Z and X to be aligned is indeed equal 
to (1-cos(theta_XZ))/2, where theta_XZ lies in a region defined by theta_XY and theta_YZ and the Euclidean 
constraints on angles.
